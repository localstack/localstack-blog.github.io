Earlier this year, we unveiled LocalStack 2.0, which brought forth many new features and improvements, along with better integration with the AWS tooling ecosystem. With the 3.0 release, we’re doubling down on our promise to boost developer productivity and tackle the issues that often slow down cloud software development and delivery workflows — specifically, simplifying onboarding and eliminating the inefficiencies that lead to prolonged development and test cycles.</description></item><item><title>Mastering AWS Infrastructure Testing with LocalStack Cloud Pods - on localhost, CI and Testcontainers</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-02-20-cloud-pods-local-to-ci-and-testcontainers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-02-20-cloud-pods-local-to-ci-and-testcontainers/</guid><description>Cloud Pods, State &amp;amp; Persistence in the LocalStack ecosystem In a few words, LocalStack is a cloud service emulator that allows you to develop and test your cloud and serverless applications locally by replicating AWS environments on any machine without the need to deploy them to the actual AWS cloud. This tool provides an easy and cost-effective way to test cloud applications by locally providing all the necessary dependencies.
LocalStack ships as a Docker container, making its state ephemeral by default.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 50,000 GitHub Stars for LocalStack!</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-03-celebrating-50k-github-stars-localstack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-03-celebrating-50k-github-stars-localstack/</guid><description>Seven years ago, on August 16, 2016, the LocalStack project was born.

Keeping parity with AWS has been our mission at LocalStack since day one. This is essential for building a reliable cloud emulator that provides a great experience for cloud application developers.
Recently we introduced new mechanisms to scale the endeavor and ensure that the parity of LocalStack with AWS increases continuously over time while keeping our service implementations up-to-date.</description></item><item><title>Introducing LocalStack for Snowflake: The new emulator to build &amp; test data pipelines locally</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-05-22-introducing-localstack-for-snowflake/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-05-22-introducing-localstack-for-snowflake/</guid><description>Introduction We are excited to announce the public preview of LocalStack for Snowflake ❄️.

The year has only just started, and our development pipeline is bursting with even more things to come.
Taking a step back and looking at our offering, we noticed that Pro is not really a fitting name for the starter tier.</description></item><item><title>How we are making connecting to LocalStack easier</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-04-making-connecting-to-localstack-easier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-04-making-connecting-to-localstack-easier/</guid><description>LocalStack normally runs in a Docker container, meaning that it is isolated from the host system. By default, LocalStack publishes its edge port (usually 4566) to the host. Publishing a port means that a port on the host forwards network communications to the LocalStack container. Requests made to localhost:4566 are then forwarded to the container.
This works well when interacting from the host, for example, using awslocal commands. However, making requests to localhost:4566 does not work when trying to connect to LocalStack from your containers, or LocalStack compute resources such as Lambda functions or ECS containers.</description></item><item><title>Add Authentication &amp; Authorization to LocalStack with the Authress extension</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-02-07-add-authentication-authorization-to-localstack-with-the-authress-extension/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-02-07-add-authentication-authorization-to-localstack-with-the-authress-extension/</guid><description>Introduction The Authress extension for LocalStack, our first community extension, enables running Authress directly on your machine. It provides a high-fidelity, fully local authentication and authorization service, which bypasses the need to rely on the live version for local development.
Ensuring your users can access your software while maintaining the privacy of their data and clean tenant separation is not a trivial challenge. It’s not just about supporting different login mechanisms and protecting the personal data included in the user identity.</description></item><item><title>Neurolytics enhances the efficiency and agility of its cloud-based development with LocalStack</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-25-localstack-neurolyticsai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-25-localstack-neurolyticsai/</guid><description>“LocalStack has made cloud development easier to test and debug, significantly reducing our development and testing loops by approximately 30%.
