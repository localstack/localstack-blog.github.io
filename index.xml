LocalStack runs as a Docker container, and it’s ephemeral local resources like S3 buckets or Lambda functions are destroyed when you stop the container. However, you would like to persist &amp;amp; save certain resources for testing, debugging, or experimenting. That’s where LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Pods come in.
Cloud Pods are snapshots of your LocalStack’s state that are stored on the LocalStack Web Application.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the LocalStack 3.7 release!</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-08-29-localstack-release-v-3-7-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-08-29-localstack-release-v-3-7-0/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack 3.7 is now available!

Anyone who understands the scale and scope of AWS services could have been forgiven for thinking that the idea of a local emulator for AWS rested more on the insanity side of that line. And yet, LocalStack exists.
This feat of engineering is apparently not enough for our team however. &amp;ldquo;What if we took the local emulator for cloud services and then put it back in the cloud?</description></item><item><title>Simulating outages for local cloud apps with LocalStack Chaos API</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-08-26-simulating-outages-for-local-cloud-apps-with-localstack-chaos-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-08-26-simulating-outages-for-local-cloud-apps-with-localstack-chaos-api/</guid><description>Introduction Regardless of the precautions you take in developing your application and the reliability of cloud providers like AWS, incidents are unavoidable. They can be anything from as large-scale regional outage to as small as a request failing for reasons perhaps unknown. Common examples might include:
Region-wide outages DNS failovers Service failures Network faults The key is in building your application in such a way that it handles these situations gracefully.</description></item><item><title>Developing cloud AI-powered apps with LocalStack and Ollama</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-07-04-develop-cloud-ai-with-ollama-localstack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-07-04-develop-cloud-ai-with-ollama-localstack/</guid><description>Introduction In today’s tech landscape, large language models (LLMs) and AI are transforming both tech-centric and traditional businesses. AI functionality is being integrated across various platforms to enhance user experience. However, developing and testing these AI integrations often requires extensive infrastructure, leading to high costs. LocalStack enables developers to build and test AI integrations locally, which accelerates the development process and avoids extra expenses.
In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore building an AI-powered chatbot using Ollama, a tool that lets users interact with information through natural language.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack Named to Redpoint InfraRed 100 List</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-06-18-redpoint-infrared-100/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-06-18-redpoint-infrared-100/</guid><description>New York, NY – June 18, 2024 – LocalStack, the leading tool for cloud infrastructure emulation, is thrilled to announce its inclusion in the 2024 Redpoint InfraRed 100 list.

The year has only just started, and our development pipeline is bursting with even more things to come.
Taking a step back and looking at our offering, we noticed that Pro is not really a fitting name for the starter tier.</description></item><item><title>How we are making connecting to LocalStack easier</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-04-making-connecting-to-localstack-easier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-04-making-connecting-to-localstack-easier/</guid><description>LocalStack normally runs in a Docker container, meaning that it is isolated from the host system. By default, LocalStack publishes its edge port (usually 4566) to the host. Publishing a port means that a port on the host forwards network communications to the LocalStack container. Requests made to localhost:4566 are then forwarded to the container.
This works well when interacting from the host, for example, using awslocal commands. However, making requests to localhost:4566 does not work when trying to connect to LocalStack from your containers, or LocalStack compute resources such as Lambda functions or ECS containers.</description></item><item><title>Mastering AWS Infrastructure Testing with LocalStack Cloud Pods - on localhost, CI and Testcontainers</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-02-20-cloud-pods-local-to-ci-and-testcontainers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-02-20-cloud-pods-local-to-ci-and-testcontainers/</guid><description>Cloud Pods, State &amp;amp; Persistence in the LocalStack ecosystem In a few words, LocalStack is a cloud service emulator that allows you to develop and test your cloud and serverless applications locally by replicating AWS environments on any machine without the need to deploy them to the actual AWS cloud. This tool provides an easy and cost-effective way to test cloud applications by locally providing all the necessary dependencies.
LocalStack ships as a Docker container, making its state ephemeral by default.</description></item><item><title>Add Authentication &amp; Authorization to LocalStack with the Authress extension</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-02-07-add-authentication-authorization-to-localstack-with-the-authress-extension/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-02-07-add-authentication-authorization-to-localstack-with-the-authress-extension/</guid><description>Introduction The Authress extension for LocalStack, our first community extension, enables running Authress directly on your machine. It provides a high-fidelity, fully local authentication and authorization service, which bypasses the need to rely on the live version for local development.
Ensuring your users can access your software while maintaining the privacy of their data and clean tenant separation is not a trivial challenge. It’s not just about supporting different login mechanisms and protecting the personal data included in the user identity.</description></item><item><title>Neurolytics enhances the efficiency and agility of its cloud-based development with LocalStack</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-25-localstack-neurolyticsai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-25-localstack-neurolyticsai/</guid><description>“LocalStack has made cloud development easier to test and debug, significantly reducing our development and testing loops by approximately 30%.
