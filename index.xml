Earlier this year, we unveiled LocalStack 2.0, which brought forth many new features and improvements, along with better integration with the AWS tooling ecosystem. With the 3.0 release, we’re doubling down on our promise to boost developer productivity and tackle the issues that often slow down cloud software development and delivery workflows — specifically, simplifying onboarding and eliminating the inefficiencies that lead to prolonged development and test cycles.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 50,000 GitHub Stars for LocalStack!</title><link>/2024-01-03-celebrating-50k-github-stars-localstack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2024-01-03-celebrating-50k-github-stars-localstack/</guid><description>Seven years ago, on August 16, 2016, the LocalStack project was born. The journey since then has been nothing short of incredible. LocalStack has now crossed 50,000 stars on GitHub after three major releases and dozens of minor releases. For the past 16 months since LocalStack 1.0 went live, it has been on a consistent upward trajectory, and we are proud of everyone who is discovering, starring, and joining our project &amp;amp; community!</description></item><item><title>AWS re:Invent - Ten Things You Need to Know About LocalStack</title><link>/2023-11-27-ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-localstack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2023-11-27-ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-localstack/</guid><description>In an era dominated by cloud computing, developing and testing software locally before deploying it to the cloud for production is essential, as it allows for thorough, controlled testing environments, quicker iteration, and reduced dependency on cloud resources during the development phase, leading to more robust and reliable cloud-deployed applications.
Here at AWS re:Invent, a recurring question captures our attention: &amp;ldquo;What is LocalStack?&amp;quot; - A query that sparks conversations about innovation, local development solutions, and the seamless transition to the cloud environment.</description></item><item><title>Introducing LocalStack Desktop Application for local cloud development &amp; testing</title><link>/2023-11-09-introducing-localstack-desktop-application-for-local-cloud-development-testing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2023-11-09-introducing-localstack-desktop-application-for-local-cloud-development-testing/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that we have released an all-new Desktop Application to make cloud development with LocalStack a breeze! The Desktop application underscores our unwavering commitment to make LocalStack accessible for our users, who would like to use a local cloud sandbox for development, testing, and experimentation, and truly embrace the inner dev loop. LocalStack enables users to control, manage, and visualize over 80+ emulated AWS cloud services, running entirely on your local machine.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack and AWS Parity Explained</title><link>/2022-08-04-parity-explained/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022-08-04-parity-explained/</guid><description>Parity for LocalStack means that when you, as a cloud developer, make an AWS API call to LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s cloud emulator, it behaves the same way AWS would.
Keeping parity with AWS has been our mission at LocalStack since day one. This is essential for building a reliable cloud emulator that provides a great experience for cloud application developers.
Recently we introduced new mechanisms to scale the endeavor and ensure that the parity of LocalStack with AWS increases continuously over time while keeping our service implementations up-to-date.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack has joined AWS Marketplace to streamline local cloud development &amp; testing!</title><link>/2023-09-07-localstack-has-joined-aws-marketplace-to-streamline-local-cloud-development-testing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2023-09-07-localstack-has-joined-aws-marketplace-to-streamline-local-cloud-development-testing/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that LocalStack is now available in the AWS Marketplace.

It provides a high-fidelity, fully local authentication and authorization service, which bypasses the need to rely on the live version for local development.
Ensuring your users can access your software while maintaining the privacy of their data and clean tenant separation is not a trivial challenge. It’s not just about supporting different login mechanisms and protecting the personal data included in the user identity.</description></item><item><title>Neurolytics enhances the efficiency and agility of its cloud-based development with LocalStack</title><link>/2024-01-25-localstack-neurolyticsai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2024-01-25-localstack-neurolyticsai/</guid><description>“LocalStack has made cloud development easier to test and debug, significantly reducing our development and testing loops by approximately 30%.

The dev environment should mimic the production environment as closely as possible. This comes with a cost: testing cloud applications is cumbersome as they have many moving parts. For instance, if you build a simple Lambda function in AWS, you might use services such as CloudWatch, S3, IAM, etc.
Imagine configuring your project and provisioning these cloud resources in a test environment every time for developing new features.</description></item><item><title>Announcing LocalStack Extensions</title><link>/2022-09-12-announcing-localstack-extensions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 05:51:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>/2022-09-12-announcing-localstack-extensions/</guid><description>With the LocalStack 1.0 General Availability going live last month, we announced LocalStack Extensions!
