With Shipyard, you can now deploy your cloud applications in short-lived environments to enable developer teams to run tests, preview features, and get alignment with cross-departmental projects. Shipyard also enables application previews on every pull request and simplifies monitoring, debugging, and deployment all from one dashboard!</description></item></channel></rss>
