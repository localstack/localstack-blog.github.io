By default, LocalStack publishes its edge port (usually 4566) to the host. Publishing a port means that a port on the host forwards network communications to the LocalStack container. Requests made to localhost:4566 are then forwarded to the container.
This works well when interacting from the host, for example, using awslocal commands. However, making requests to localhost:4566 does not work when trying to connect to LocalStack from your containers, or LocalStack compute resources such as Lambda functions or ECS containers.</description></item></channel></rss>
