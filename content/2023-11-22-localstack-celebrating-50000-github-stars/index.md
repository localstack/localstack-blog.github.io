WIP: Introduction

## How did we get here?

LocalStack's journey to achieving 50,000 GitHub stars is a story of community-driven growth and engagement. It all started with the initial commit ([`44326584`](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/commit/44326584#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5)) written at Atlassian, offering an easy-to-use mocking framework for cloud application development, primarily focusing on AWS Cloud. It began with support for 8 AWS services including Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and others. The idea of emulating AWS APIs on local machines was conceived to allow developers to work on their applications offline, even in scenarios like commuting on a train, or on a flight. 

Initially treated as a side project, the first exposure to the public was in the form of a [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13966088) (mirrored on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231122065745/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13966088)), introducing our idea for fully local dev&test loop for building cloud application. This initial exposure caught the attention of the broader tech community, including key figures within AWS. A particularly impactful moment was when Jeff Barr, the chief evangelist of AWS, [tweeted about LocalStack](https://twitter.com/jeffbarr/status/846382903210663936) (mirrored on the [Internet Archive]()), leading to an overnight surge in GitHub stars, with thousands joining our community.

Here is a graphic that captures the watershed moment, and the subsequent growth of LocalStack as a project:

The community's response was overwhelmingly positive — developers began actively contributing to LocalStack, creating issues, providing reproducible cases, and submitting pull requests. This engagement wasn't just from individual developers — entire teams from various companies, specifically those focused on developer experience, started using LocalStack to create efficient development environments.

After three major releases and years of active development, we have achieved what we set out to do — building **faster development cycles** with instant development loops, providing **better isolation** of application logic in test environments, and setting up **enhanced security** with no dependency on a remote cloud service for execution. As always, we are grounding our work on user insights and feedback, and we are excited to have such a committed community!

## What's next?

The best is yet to come! We are primarily working on making our users happy with new features and improving LocalStack as much as we can do. With the [3.0 release](https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-16-announcing-localstack-30-general-availability/), LocalStack has evolved from being an open-source project to an enterprise development framework! We have also received a lot of feedback from our individual users, and we've heard you loud and clear — We're super excited to bring our **Hobby Plan** for individuals *who are not using LocalStack commercially*!

We want to **lower the barrier of entry** for everybody and make it **easier to get started**. With the Hobby Plan, we want to enable more users to use the LocalStack emulator with all its otherwise **paid features**. LocalStack's Hobby Plan allows you to get started with:

- [Advanced AWS services](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/)
- [CI Starter Tier](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/ci/ci-keys/)
- [IAM Policy Enforcement](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/security-testing/iam-enforcement/)
- [State Persistence](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/persistence-mechanism/)

LocalStack is deeply rooted in open source and by making LocalStack available for free for non-commercial projects we hope to **further support and give back to the open source community**. It is the easiest way to get into cloud development and to learn not only the specific AWS services but also general cloud concepts that are also applicable to all the other cloud platforms out there. Using the Hobby Plan does not require a credit card, no need to set up an AWS account and there is also no cost risk (or using up the **AWS Free Tier**).
