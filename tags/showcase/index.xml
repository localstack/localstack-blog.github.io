This tool provides an easy and cost-effective way to test cloud applications by locally providing all the necessary dependencies.
LocalStack ships as a Docker container, making its state ephemeral by default.</description></item><item><title>AWS re:Invent - Ten Things You Need to Know About LocalStack</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-27-ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-localstack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-27-ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-localstack/</guid><description>In an era dominated by cloud computing, developing and testing software locally before deploying it to the cloud for production is essential, as it allows for thorough, controlled testing environments, quicker iteration, and reduced dependency on cloud resources during the development phase, leading to more robust and reliable cloud-deployed applications.
Here at AWS re:Invent, a recurring question captures our attention: &amp;ldquo;What is LocalStack?&amp;quot; - A query that sparks conversations about innovation, local development solutions, and the seamless transition to the cloud environment.</description></item><item><title>Develop your Cloudflare Workers + AWS apps locally with LocalStack &amp; Miniflare</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-06-26-develop-your-cloudflare-workers-aws-apps-locally-with-localstack-miniflare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-06-26-develop-your-cloudflare-workers-aws-apps-locally-with-localstack-miniflare/</guid><description>LocalStack is a cloud development platform that turbocharges your cloud application development &amp;amp; testing, fosters team collaboration, and provides an integrated cloud developer experience with a local cloud sandbox. LocalStackâ€™s core cloud emulator runs inside a Docker container and provides a set of external network ports for integrations, SDKs, or CI providers for developers to execute their cloud &amp;amp; serverless applications fully locally without talking to the real cloud services. This enables a highly efficient development loop, by reducing the feedback cycles from minutes to seconds.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack x Gitpod - Run cloud applications with LocalStack and Gitpod</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2022-09-26-localstack-x-gitpod-run-cloud-applications-with-localstack-and-gitpod/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 11:31:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2022-09-26-localstack-x-gitpod-run-cloud-applications-with-localstack-and-gitpod/</guid><description>Shipping applications to production requires them to be battle-tested in the dev environment. The dev environment should mimic the production environment as closely as possible. This comes with a cost: testing cloud applications is cumbersome as they have many moving parts. For instance, if you build a simple Lambda function in AWS, you might use services such as CloudWatch, S3, IAM, etc.
Imagine configuring your project and provisioning these cloud resources in a test environment every time for developing new features.</description></item><item><title>Test Monitoring for LocalStack Apps</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2021-09-16-test-monitoring-for-localstack-apps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:10:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2021-09-16-test-monitoring-for-localstack-apps/</guid><description>ðŸ“¢ Thundra Inc and its product Foresight have ceased operations and have been acquired by Catchpoint, resulting in significant changes to their products and services. Please note that the tutorial provided in our blog may no longer be applicable or functional with the latest updates. We are keeping this blog post available for informational purposes only.
