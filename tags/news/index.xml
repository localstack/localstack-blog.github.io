DDL/DML/DQL operations on warehouses, databases, schemas, and tables; Storing files in Snowflake stages; Tasks for scheduled execution; Snowpipe streaming with Kafka connector; User-defined functions (UDFs) in JavaScript and Python; Table streams for change data capture (CDC) and audit logs; Cross-database resource sharing; Basic support for running Streamlit applications locally; Infrastructure-as-code with Terraform &amp;amp; Pulumi; Test your data applications in Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines with GitHub Actions, CircleCI &amp;amp; GitLab CI (among others); Enterprise-tested features like Cloud Pods and Persistence for state snapshots.</description></item><item><title>Renaming the Pro Tier</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-22-pro-starter-rename/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-22-pro-starter-rename/</guid><description>There is a lot going on here at LocalStack, with different teams continuously delivering features and improvements in the core AWS emulator, as well as the web app and additional services. The year has only just started, and our development pipeline is bursting with even more things to come.
Taking a step back and looking at our offering, we noticed that Pro is not really a fitting name for the starter tier.</description></item><item><title>How we are making connecting to LocalStack easier</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-04-making-connecting-to-localstack-easier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-04-making-connecting-to-localstack-easier/</guid><description>LocalStack normally runs in a Docker container, meaning that it is isolated from the host system. By default, LocalStack publishes its edge port (usually 4566) to the host. Publishing a port means that a port on the host forwards network communications to the LocalStack container. Requests made to localhost:4566 are then forwarded to the container.
This works well when interacting from the host, for example, using awslocal commands. However, making requests to localhost:4566 does not work when trying to connect to LocalStack from your containers, or LocalStack compute resources such as Lambda functions or ECS containers.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 50,000 GitHub Stars for LocalStack!</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-03-celebrating-50k-github-stars-localstack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-03-celebrating-50k-github-stars-localstack/</guid><description>Seven years ago, on August 16, 2016, the LocalStack project was born.

It allows developers to shorten their feedback loop by enabling them to develop, test, and deploy their applications locally while reducing costs and improving agility.
LocalStack supports integration wrappers for AWS CLI, CDK, Terraform, to enable developers to connect to the local cloud emulator. However, maintaining these wrappers requires additional effort, and developers would like to switch from AWS to LocalStack in a click.</description></item><item><title>Announcing LocalStack 3.0 General Availability!</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-16-announcing-localstack-30-general-availability/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-16-announcing-localstack-30-general-availability/</guid><description>Today, we are excited to announce LocalStack 3.0, our latest major release aiming to empower developers with a high-fidelity local cloud development &amp;amp; testing experience.
