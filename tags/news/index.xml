Earlier this year, we unveiled LocalStack 2.0, which brought forth many new features and improvements, along with better integration with the AWS tooling ecosystem. With the 3.0 release, we’re doubling down on our promise to boost developer productivity and tackle the issues that often slow down cloud software development and delivery workflows — specifically, simplifying onboarding and eliminating the inefficiencies that lead to prolonged development and test cycles.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 50,000 GitHub Stars for LocalStack!</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-03-celebrating-50k-github-stars-localstack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-01-03-celebrating-50k-github-stars-localstack/</guid><description>Seven years ago, on August 16, 2016, the LocalStack project was born. The journey since then has been nothing short of incredible. LocalStack has now crossed 50,000 stars on GitHub after three major releases and dozens of minor releases. For the past 16 months since LocalStack 1.0 went live, it has been on a consistent upward trajectory, and we are proud of everyone who is discovering, starring, and joining our project &amp;amp; community!</description></item><item><title>Introducing LocalStack Desktop Application for local cloud development &amp; testing</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-09-introducing-localstack-desktop-application-for-local-cloud-development-testing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-09-introducing-localstack-desktop-application-for-local-cloud-development-testing/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that we have released an all-new Desktop Application to make cloud development with LocalStack a breeze! The Desktop application underscores our unwavering commitment to make LocalStack accessible for our users, who would like to use a local cloud sandbox for development, testing, and experimentation, and truly embrace the inner dev loop. LocalStack enables users to control, manage, and visualize over 80+ emulated AWS cloud services, running entirely on your local machine.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack and AWS Parity Explained</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2022-08-04-parity-explained/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2022-08-04-parity-explained/</guid><description>Parity for LocalStack means that when you, as a cloud developer, make an AWS API call to LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s cloud emulator, it behaves the same way AWS would.
Keeping parity with AWS has been our mission at LocalStack since day one. This is essential for building a reliable cloud emulator that provides a great experience for cloud application developers.
Recently we introduced new mechanisms to scale the endeavor and ensure that the parity of LocalStack with AWS increases continuously over time while keeping our service implementations up-to-date.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack has joined AWS Marketplace to streamline local cloud development &amp; testing!</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-09-07-localstack-has-joined-aws-marketplace-to-streamline-local-cloud-development-testing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-09-07-localstack-has-joined-aws-marketplace-to-streamline-local-cloud-development-testing/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that LocalStack is now available in the AWS Marketplace. LocalStack is the leading platform for local development and testing of cloud applications. LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Emulator allows you to effectively run over 80 AWS services directly on your local machine and on CI/CD systems to significantly cut down on development time and feedback cycles. At its core, LocalStack provides a growing ecosystem of native integrations that encompasses crucial components such as CI/CD providers, application development frameworks, programming language SDKs, Infrastructure-as-Code tools, and more.</description></item><item><title>Renaming the Pro Tier</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-22-pro-starter-rename/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-22-pro-starter-rename/</guid><description>There is a lot going on here at LocalStack, with different teams continuously delivering features and improvements in the core AWS emulator, as well as the web app and additional services. The year has only just started, and our development pipeline is bursting with even more things to come.
Taking a step back and looking at our offering, we noticed that Pro is not really a fitting name for the starter tier.</description></item><item><title>How we are making connecting to LocalStack easier</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-04-making-connecting-to-localstack-easier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2024-03-04-making-connecting-to-localstack-easier/</guid><description>LocalStack normally runs in a Docker container, meaning that it is isolated from the host system. By default, LocalStack publishes its edge port (usually 4566) to the host. Publishing a port means that a port on the host forwards network communications to the LocalStack container. Requests made to localhost:4566 are then forwarded to the container.
This works well when interacting from the host, for example, using awslocal commands. However, making requests to localhost:4566 does not work when trying to connect to LocalStack from your containers, or LocalStack compute resources such as Lambda functions or ECS containers.</description></item><item><title>One Click Local Development: Announcing Leapp's LocalStack Integration</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-12-18-one-click-local-development-announcing-leapps-localstack-integration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-12-18-one-click-local-development-announcing-leapps-localstack-integration/</guid><description>LocalStack enables a fully functional cloud stack to emulate AWS cloud services on your local machine. It allows developers to shorten their feedback loop by enabling them to develop, test, and deploy their applications locally while reducing costs and improving agility.
LocalStack supports integration wrappers for AWS CLI, CDK, Terraform, to enable developers to connect to the local cloud emulator. However, maintaining these wrappers requires additional effort, and developers would like to switch from AWS to LocalStack in a click.</description></item><item><title>Join LocalStack at AWS re:Invent 2023</title><link>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-09-join-localstack-at-aws-reinvent-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.localstack.cloud/2023-11-09-join-localstack-at-aws-reinvent-2023/</guid><description>LocalStack is excited to be participating in AWS re:Invent 2023, Amazon&amp;rsquo;s premier annual cloud computing conference.
